BARTR
A Skill-Barter Platform — Learn & Teach Without Money

BARTR is a full-stack web application where users trade skills using time-based credits instead of money. Users earn credits by teaching what they know and spend credits to learn from others. The platform focuses on trust, real-time interaction, and fair exchange.
